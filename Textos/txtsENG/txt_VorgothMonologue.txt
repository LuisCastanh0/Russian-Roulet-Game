Look who decided to show up! Long time no see!
Remember me? No? What a shame. I'm Vorgoth, the devil you made a deal with a long time ago.
You sought me out in the past, offering your soul in exchange for something.
What was it again?
What a crappy wish... But anyway, it's time to pay up.
Luckily for you, I've been very bored lately...
I need a bit of excitement, so I've decided we're going to play a game.
A game of Russian roulette! You know how it works, right?
A revolver, a bullet. Spin the chamber, pull the trigger. The lucky one who gets shot loses.
If you win, your debt will be forgiven. If you lose, I collect your soul and move on with my life.
I almost forgot! To make the game more interesting, you'll spin the chamber before each shot.
